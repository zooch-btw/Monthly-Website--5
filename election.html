            <h4>TJ was a part of the Democratic-Republican party. Thomas Jefferson's goal as president was to restore
                the principles of the American Revolution. Not only had the Federalists levied oppressive taxes,
                stretched the provisions of the Constitution, and established a bastion of wealth and special privilege
                in the creation of a national bank, they also had subverted civil liberties and expanded the powers of
                the central government at the expense of the states. A new revolution was necessary, "as real a
                revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form." What was needed was a
                return to basic republican principles.
            </h4>
            <h4>These disputes came to a head when a Federalist Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798,
                which, among other things, criminalized criticism of Congress and the president. The legislatures of
                Kentucky and Virginia passed resolutions threatening the nonenforcement of what they perceived as
                unconstitutional laws, but that move was broadly unpopular. United States presidential election of 1800,
                American presidential election held in 1800, in which Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson was elected
                as the country’s third president after defeating incumbent John Adams; Alexander Hamilton, a Federalist
                and longtime enemy of Burr’s, tried to engineer support for Jefferson. Still, Burr maintained that he
                would not challenge Jefferson—an assertion that Jefferson did not wholly accept.
            </h4>
            <h4>On the first ballot Jefferson was the choice of eight states, while Burr was supported by six (all with
                a Federalist majority among their congressional representatives), and two were split. After more than 30
                more ballots were held over the next several days, the results were the same. Finally, after 36 ballots
                and with Federalists in Maryland and Vermont abstaining, giving those states to Jefferson, Jefferson was
                elected president (with Burr as vice president) on February 17 by a majority of 10 states to 4 (Delaware
                and South Carolina cast blank votes). The election was a catalyst for the adoption of the Twelfth
                Amendment (1804), under which electors would cast separate ballots for president and vice president.
