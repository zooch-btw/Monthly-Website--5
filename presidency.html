            <h4>Thomas Jefferson envisioned a government that was "wise and frugal," limiting its intervention except to
                prevent harm while respecting state authority. He sought to reduce bureaucracy and national debt,
                believing in a smaller federal government. His military policy aimed to eliminate Alexander Hamilton’s
                standing army, relying instead on a disciplined militia for national defense. Jefferson significantly
                reduced the Army and Navy, cutting down military expenses to align with his vision of limited
                government.
            </h4>
            <h4>Economically, Jefferson promoted agriculture as the foundation of the economy, viewing commerce as a
                support system rather than a driving force. He reduced presidential appointments and pushed Congress to
                abolish the direct tax of 1798. He also repealed the Alien and Sedition Acts and pardoned those
                imprisoned under them. His fiscal achievements included the Louisiana Purchase for $15 million, which
                doubled the nation's size, and reducing the national debt from $80 million to $57 million within two
                years. However, his presidency also faced challenges, such as the First Barbary War (1801–1805) against
                North African pirates and the controversial Embargo Act of 1807, which aimed to protect U.S. interests
                but hurt American trade.
            </h4>
            <h4>Jefferson is best remembered as the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and the third
                president of the United States. Despite championing universal rights, he owned over 600 enslaved people,
                making his legacy deeply complex. His presidency ended after two terms, and he was succeeded by his
                Secretary of State, James Madison, who continued the Democratic-Republican leadership. Jefferson's
                policies and decisions shaped the early United States, emphasizing limited government, agrarian values,
                and westward expansion while also stirring debate over issues like slavery and trade restrictions.
