            <h4>Thomas Jefferson retired to his Virginia plantation home, Monticello. The former President was happy to
                be free from executive duties and eager to satisfy his boundless curiosity for life.In retirement,
                Jefferson pursued science and natural history through research, experimentation, and invention.He
                continued in his post as the elected president of the American Philosophical Society until 1815. He
                tackled Plato's Republic in the original Greek as well as Greek versions of the Bible.
            </h4>
            <h4>All the while, he kept up an extensive private correspondence with friends and acquaintances all over
                the world. Nothing, however, attracted Jefferson's attention more than his pet project, the University
                of Virginia. Jefferson designed all of its campus buildings, set up its curriculum, selected its
                faculty, and joyfully nurtured it into existence. He proudly thought his work at the university a
                fitting conclusion to his life of public service. Even as he struggled to make ends meet, Jefferson
                enjoyed his popularity until becoming ill on July 4, 1826, Washington D.C
